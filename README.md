# Cloud_Tasks

Challenge #1

A 3-tier environment is a common setup. Use a tool of your choosing/familiarity create these resources on a cloud environment (Azure/AWS/GCP). Please remember we will not be judged on the outcome but more focusing on the approach, style and reproducibility.
 
Challenge #2

We need to write code that will query the meta data of an instance within Azure or AWS or GCP and provide a JSON formatted output. 
The choice of language and implementation is up to you.

Bonus Points
The code allows for a particular data key to be retrieved individually

Challenge #3

We have a nested object. We would like a function where you pass in the object and a key and get back the value. 
The choice of language and implementation is up to you.

Example Inputs
object = {“a”:{“b”:{“c”:”d”}}}
key = a/b/c
object = {“x”:{“y”:{“z”:”a”}}}
key = x/y/z
value = a
